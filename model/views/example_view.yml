# In Cube, views are used to expose slices of your data graph and act as data marts.
# You can control which measures and dimensions are exposed to BIs or data apps,
# as well as the direction of joins between the exposed cubes.
# You can learn more about views in documentation here - https://cube.dev/docs/schema/reference/view


# The following example shows a view defined on top of orders and customers cubes.
# Both orders and customers cubes are exposed using the "includes" parameter to
# control which measures and dimensions are exposed.
# Prefixes can also be applied when exposing measures or dimensions.
# In this case, the customers' city dimension is prefixed with the cube name,
# resulting in "customers_city" when querying the view.
